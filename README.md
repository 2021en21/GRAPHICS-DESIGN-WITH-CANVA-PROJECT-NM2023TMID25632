III B.A ENGLISH

SUBRAMANYA COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE THALAYUTHU PALANI

THIS COURSE IS VERY USEFUL FOR ME THIS COURSE IS ALSO A PROFESSIONAL COURSE THIS COURSE IS ONE OF THE ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATION FOR JOB SEARCHING  

OUR MENTOR HAS SUPPORTED US IN A GREAT WAY BY MAKING US TO ATTEND AND COMPLETE THE PROJECTS IN TIME AND ALSO CONVAY THE INFORMATIONS FROM SMARTINTERNZ AND NAAN MUDHALVAN AND ALSO HAD CLEARED THE DOUBTS REGARDING PROJECTS

SMARTINTERNZ PLATFORM IS A NEW WAY OF LEARNING AND IT IS A NEW EXPERIENCE AND IT HAD GIVEN US A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE IN A FREE WAY AND MADE US EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE TOPICS AND THE PROJECTS THE TEACHING AND THE SUPPORT OF THE STAFFS WAS EXTREMLY EXTAORDINARY

I AM SO THANKFUL FOR NAAN MUDHALVAN AND THE TN GOVERNMENT FOR ORGANIZING SUCH A SCHEME WHICH IS VERY MUCH HELPFUL FOR THE STUDENTS IN A GREAT WAY WHICH HELP US LEARN NEW COURSES FREELY AND ALSO ENJOY LEARNING NEW IDEAS AND WHICH WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE JOB ORIENTATIONS
